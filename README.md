## What Is Scuttlebutt?

Historically, sea-slang for gossip - a scuttlebutt is basically a watercooler on a ship.

Scuttlebutt is a decent(ralised) secure gossip platform.

## How To Get Started

The easiest way to get started is using [patchwork](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork), a classic social networking [application](./applications.md).

## Download and Install Patchwork

Download installers for Windows, macOS and Linux from [patchwork/releases](https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork/releases)

Or you can build from source with [node and npm installed](https://github.com/creationix/nvm):

```shell
$ git clone https://github.com/ssbc/patchwork
$ cd patchwork
$ npm install
$ npm start
```

On Linux you'll need some more dependencies for the spell-checker. On Debian/Ubuntu:

```sh
sudo apt-get install libxext-dev libxtst-dev libxkbfile-dev
```

### Be Invited To A Pub

In order to gossip outside your local network, you'll need to connect to a [Pub](./concepts/pub.md).

Here's an 100-use invite to @mixmix's pub:

```txt
pub.mixmix.io:8008:@uRECWB4KIeKoNMis2UYWyB2aQPvWmS3OePQvBj2zClg=.ed25519~gq+n8AXMdhzwnGWZxWitgczTkbr70drnbEaOi3Noo5M=
```

In `patchwork`, click "+ Join Pub" and paste the code.

This will cause you to follow @mixmix's Pub and vise versa. If you haven't synchronized to this social network yet, prepare to wait a few minutes while your local server synchronizes.

## About This Handbook

To view the public gitbook, browse to <http://scuttlebutt.nz>.

You can also build and serve this with gitbook locally. The following assumes you're running a scuttlebot server and are in the follow neighbourhood of mixmix or his pub.

```bash
npm install git-ssb -g
git clone ssb://%lJsDWwnF4bDxHWYuSjw/bW37xg+saF8WtPZYZsefKj0=.sha256 ssb-handbook

cd ssb-handbook
npm install
npm start
```

The `SUMMARY.md` is the manifest on which the compiled gitbook is based. Edit that if you want content in/out of the book.

> If you see a job that needs doing - that is your job.
